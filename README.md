Link Swapper
============

The link swapper is a simple js script that swaps multiple links out of a document.

A friend had a web page where he needed to swap out links like this, and since I'm in a JavaScript class right now and we've only barely started talking about manipulating the DOM, it seemed like a good exercise.
